Claude Usage is now running in the menu bar.

First run
  The limits come from the "Claude Code-credentials" Keychain item, which holds
  the OAuth token this app sends to Anthropic's usage endpoint. It is read
  through /usr/bin/security, which Claude Code has already authorised, so there
  should be no password prompt — see "The Keychain" in the README for why that
  detour is what stops the prompt coming back every twelve hours.

  If the limits say "Sign-in expired", start Claude Code. Only the CLI can mint
  a fresh token; this app can only read the one it leaves behind.

Recommended, once: ../StatusItemKit/scripts/setup-signing.sh
